# FakeOrReal
# Hi everyone!
# I'm here with a very different project today. The increase in the use of social media today has led to the spread of rapid and fake news. 
# Thanks to the data I received from kaggle, I observed the efficiency on the test set by creating NLP machine learning models(Random Forest Classification, Naïve Bayes). 
# The data includes approximately 50000 news content and news headlines that were released between 2016 and 2018. The results were very attractive and the accuracy of the models turned out quite well. 
# You can see the confusion matrixes and changes in the number of Real-fake news’ graphs and tables.
# I am still working on this project. Since the data is very large, the models take a long time to run. 
# I will share my new models and more interactive programming with you in the future. 
# If you have suggestions and improvements, feel free to share with me. 
# You can find the data on the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
