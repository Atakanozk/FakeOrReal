# FakeOrReal
Hi everyone!
I'm here with a very different project today. The increase in the use of social media today has led to the spread of rapid and fake news. Thanks to the data I received from Kaggle, I created NLP machine learning models (Random Forest Classification, Naïve Bayes) and observed their efficiency on the test set. The data include approximately 50 000 news content and news headlines that were released between 2016 and 2018. The accuracy of the models turned out quite well. You can see the confusion matrices and changes in the number of Real-fake news’ graphs and tables.
I am still working on this project. Since the dataset is very large, the models take a long time to run. I will share my new models and more interactive programming with you in the future. If you have improvement suggestion, feel free to share with me.
You can find the data on the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
